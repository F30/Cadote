Cadote: Compiler-Aided Development of Trusted Enclaves
======================================================

This is the code for my Masters Thesis. It is quite hacky research-grade code, where I had to go to the limit of what is possible with an LLVM pass. Also, there is quite some C++ code and I'm not much of a C++ programmer. Sorry about that.

For details on the idea and its limitations, read the actual thesis.

### Path Adjustments
You might have to adjust some (hardcoded) paths to the ones of your local installations. These can be found by `grep`-ing for "ADJUST".
